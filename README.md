Jamz_CS591_final_project
For Jamz, we would like to create a networking app for musicians. The basic functions/ideas are below:

The main functionalities of the app will be: 
1. a musician looking for other musicians in their local area, musicians setting up Jam sessions to show to other around and hosting (invite only OR list it on the app), and venues listing gigs tha local musicians can “apply” to with their soundcloud, or portfolio of music.
2. Musicians will be able to use the app to find other musicians to collaborate.
3. Musicians are able to connect with small venues who are looking for performers.


## Set up (this only needs to be done once)
- create personal branch\
  *git checkout -b your_name*
- push personal branch to set up tracking \
  *git push --set-upstream origin your_name*

## Basic workflow (this is everytime you work on the project)
- move to local repo 
- switch to personal branch \
  *git checkout you_name*
- update with any changes made since last time you worked \
  *git pull origin master* 
- Create new specific topic branch (ie. bugs, profile, login)\
  *git checkout -b login* 
- Do Some work
- after finishing merge with personal branch \
  *git checkout your_name* 
  *git merge login* 
- push your changes (after adds and commits)\
  *git push*
- got onto github and make a pull request
